# Worldwhat
A fun world weather quiz, powered by Django, Python and the OpenWeatherApp API.
Choose between Celsius or Fahrenheit and guess the temperate of 15 cities around the world, picked at random from a database of 200,000.
Have a chance to enter the leaderboard or just find out where you sit against the average score.
1 point if you're 5 degrees off,
2 points if you're 4 degrees off,
3 points if you're 3 degrees off,
4 points if you're 2 degrees off,
5 points if you're 1 degree off,
and a whopping 10 points if you're get it bang on!

Everything was made by me, the design was made using bootstrap, the world emoji's were made using Photoshop.
More quizzes coming to the app soon. Let's learn more about the planet we share!
